### What is this?

This is a complete Frogger game which resembles the original Arcade version from Konami (c) released in 1981, but completely rewritten
from the ground up in the C programming language, with some nice extra elements like "achievements" en 2-player deathmatch mode!

To be able to play you need an Atmel AVR Arduino compatible board, or any other custom board with a (SPI-capable) microcontroller (minimum 16 Mhz and 8K RAM)
and of course the fantastic graphics/sound shield [Gameduino](http://excamera.com/sphinx/gameduino/).

Anyway, feel free to play around with the code, fork, optimize, bug hunt or just give tips/comments.

### Frogger "Brugmania" version for the Gameduino

- No Arduino framework dependency: rewrote Arduino's SPI and Gameduino's GD library to avr-libc plain C
- Besides the single-player mode, there is also a two-player "deathmatch" mode. (They start simultaneously!)
- Maximum of 255 levels (Although reaching level 10+ is already insane)
- Increased difficulty per level: faster/more cars and faster/less river objects
- Introscreen with high scores, latest achievements, points table and ways-to-die explanation
- "Konami Code" godmode in single-player mode: press joystick up/up down/down left/left right/right and then the middle button (button 2) within 5 seconds at the intro screen.
- Diving turtle groups which face another threat to frogger
- Fine-tuned collision detection on river: frogger has to cover most of the river object edges while jumping on them, else he slips and drowns.
- 2 different dying animations: drowning in water and road splat
- Bonus insects appear in the home slots
- Swimming crocodiles appear at level 2+, their heads are deadly
- Deadly crocodiles appear in the home slots at level 3+
- Flanking otters appear at level 3+
- Crawling snakes on logs and the riverbank appear at level 3+, their heads are deadly
- Full scoring functionality (high scores with 8 character player names are saved and kept in EEPROM): 
- Maximum score is 999999 now, so players can try to beat the world record :)
    * 10 points per forward leap
    * 50 points per home save
    * 200 points per bonus insect
    * 200 points per female frog brought home save
    * 10 points x remaining timer seconds
    * 1000 points per completed level
    * 5000 points per achievement
- Every 20k points an extra life 
- Implemented 6 challenging achievements:
    * The Right Way: On any level fill the 5 frog home slots in order from left to right.
    * Speedy Gonzales: Get all 5 frogs home in any level in less than 60 seconds.
    * Larry Laffer Style: Save 5 lady frogs in one level.
    * The Hungry Pig: Eat 5 insects in one level.
    * Calling Me Chicken?: Stay foot at the bottom berm until the timer turns red. Then manage to bring frogger home safely before the timer runs out.
    * Too much Seinfeld: Get hit by a truck 2 times in one level.
- Ways to die:
    * Running into road vehicles
    * Jumping into the river's water (This frog can't swim :S)
    * Running into snakes' heads, flanking otters or into a crocodile's jaws in the river
    * Jumping into a home invaded by a crocodile
    * Staying on top of a diving turtle too long
    * Drifting off the screen by sitting on a log or turtle too long
    * Jumping into a home already occupied by a frog
    * Jumping into the side of a home or the bushes
    * Jumping against the side and bottom edges of the screen
    * Running out of time before getting a frog home

### Background

Inspired by the clear and simple Gameduino Frogger tutorial (...and of course thinking back at the fun times I had playing the original
when I was like 7/8 years old, begging for more coins from my parents :)), I decided to make a fully functional game out of it...
...3 weeks spare-time programming later, I think it's ready for prime time.

### Installation

I developed and tested the game on 2 microcontrollers:

Teensy++ 2.0 AVR AT90USB1286: 16MHZ/RAM:8K/Flash:128K/EEPROM:4K 

AVR ATMega1284P: 16MHZ/RAM:16K/Flash:128K/EEPROM:4K 

If you have another type of microcontroller (make sure you have at least 8K RAM and 32K flash), you only need to change some basic preprocessor settings and vars:

In Makefile, change the MCU type variable to match your microcontroller.
In SPI.h (communication from AVR to the Gameduino), add another "if defined(youravrmcuversion) and change the SS/MOSI/MISO/SCK pins/ports to match your AVR mcu.
In control.h (defines) / control.c (init function) (2x 4-way joystick and 2x 5 buttons), change the pins/ports to match your AVR mcu control connections.

(P.S. Only both joysticks and both CONTROL_BTN2 and CONTROL_BTN3 buttons are used in the game.)

My development platform is Xubuntu. It's very easy to install the avr-libc tool chain:

sudo aptitude install avr-libc gcc-avr gdb-avr simulavr avrdude avrdude-doc binutils-avr binutils avra libusb-1.0-0-dev libusb-dev

To transfer the game to your microcontroller, just run **make** and transfer the *frogger.hex* via *avrdude* or any other tool you're used to.
